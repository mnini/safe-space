# Safe Space


*Let's not educate kids equiped with dictionary into serial killers!*

It's been a while, we're using platfrom, where we get to kill stuff if it's not working properly or taking too much space. Processes are running because we're executing them. It sounds like dark middle age. We should bring some light light to the operation systems and introduce non-violent dictionary.

World had came to abmnomination, because we're executing binaries. 
(There is possiblity that subconcious fear of being executed caused things like gender and simillar problems. We don't really need on internet, there are neutral words are we don't really need sexuality or social roles being polarized on any work place) 


	  Any ideas?
      	 ‣instead of executing, processes can have something like do 'do' or 'process' as command
      	 ‣instead of killing, there can be something like 'forced stop'
    
Those new ideas need to be checked if are not dehonesting or incendiary or reffering to being descendant of serial murder like original words.
